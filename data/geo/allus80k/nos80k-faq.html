NOS80K - Medium Resolution Digital Vector U.S. Shoreline shapefile for the contiguous United States

</dd>
<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Medium Resolution 1:70,000 scale Digital Vector Shoreline is a high-quality, Geographic Information System-ready, general-use digital vector data set containing the coastline of the contiguous United States of America. It was created by the Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) Division of NOAA's Office of Ocean Resources Conservation and Assessment. Compiled from hundreds of NOAA coast charts, this product comprises over 75,000 nautical miles of coastline (nearly 2.5 million vertices). The shoreline was created from data captured (digitized from scanned images of the master separates of the NOS Charts) from over 270 National Ocean Service Navigation Charts and spans some 80,000 nautical miles at an average map scale of 1:70,000.

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

Generally, 1:80,000 NOAA coast charts took precedence and were used when available. For areas where 1:80,000 charts were not readily available, charts with the next closest higher scale (e.g., 1:60,0000) were used down to the highest scale available. Alternately, if higher scale charts were not available, charts of the closest lower scale (e.g., 1:100,000) were used down to the lowest scale. The digital shoreline for Florida was obtained from the state. This digital file was originally created from NOAA nautical charts and was not recreated by SEA. Generally, for these shoreline sections (EC80_06, GC80_05, and GC80_06), the highest scale charts available were used to digitize the shoreline. The resultant average mapping scale for the entire Medium Resolution Digital Vector Shoreline is approximately 1:70,000. See NOAA's Medium Resolution Digital Vector Shoreline website for more details on this product: &lt;<a href="http://coastalgeospatial.noaa.gov/shoreline.html">http://coastalgeospatial.noaa.gov/shoreline.html</a>&gt;
<br/>
Source data from charts published using the North American Datums of 1902, 1927, and 1983. 1902 and 1927 referenced data was converted to 1983 via NOAA, National Geodetic Survey Software NADCON, version 2.1.

Generation of the Medium Resolution Digital Shoreline Product was accomplished in five stages: data capture, chart cover construction, segment assembly, verification, and final formatting/archive. Stage 1, data capture involves the initial conversion of the analog source data, NOS Coastal Series Navigational Charts, into a digital vector image. During stage 2, the raw vector image is converted into an Arc/Info GIS Coverage. In addition, during this phase of the work, the data is corrected (gross error removal), topologies are constructed, descriptive information is added, and an intermediate archive is created. The third stage is segment assembly. Here, the chart cover data is partitioned into regionally contiguous groupings, (referred to as sections), adjacent boundaries are matched, and the individual charts are joined together to produce continuous shoreline segments. Following assembly, stage 4, data verification, is initiated. Portions of the sectional data are chosen at random to be plotted coincident with chart master sheets (mylars) and compared. Discrepancies are noted, corrective action, if required, is taken, and the data reverified. The fifth and final stage is formatting and final archive. The shoreline data is converted into the two ASCII formats for distribution.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the data supplied here are a compilation of information collected from some 270+ current or pre-release National Ocean Service Navigation Charts.   In compiling this product we made no attempt to ascertain the congruency between the charted data, and the real world.  Our objective was to simply capture the representative coastline as provided to us via the NOS Chart.  Every effort was made to capture the shoreline on these charts as faithfully as our skills and technology allowed, and there is every indication that we were successful to this end.  However, in doing so, we automatically conveyed the character (all aspects, both good and bad) of those data to our digital product.  A character which may or may not be in agreement with the real world.  Because of this, the user is advised to exercise caution in making any assumptions about the fallibility, or infallibility, of the spatial information supplied here; especially when circumstances warrant a high degree of absolute positional accuracy.
<br/>
Spatial data were derived directly from National Ocean Service Navigation Charts.  The NOS Chart Products meet or exceed National Map Accuracy standards (hard copy); the digital data supplied in this compilation should, when plotted at scale, meet or exceed these same cartographic standards.

This is the complete dataset as provided by NOAA.
<br/>
The Medium Resolution Shoreline incorporates the entire contiguous United States coastline as four major regions. These include: the Atlantic Coast, ranging from the United States-Canada Border at the St. Croix River to Florida Bay and the Florida Keys; the Gulf of Mexico Region, extending from northwest of the Keys to the United States-Mexico Border at the Rio Grande; the Pacific Coast Region, extending from the United States-Mexico Border at Baja to the United States-Canada Border along the Straits of Juan de Fuca; and the Great Lakes Region, which includes all of the lakes in their entirety, and the St. Lawrence River Seaway to Ogdensburg, NY. Alaska, the Hawaiian Island Archipelago, Puerto Rico, or any other U. S. interests which are not a part of the coterminous United States are not included in the collection.

The NOAA Medium Resolution, 1:70,000, Digital Vector Shoreline encompasses the entire contiguous United States coastline, some 80,000 nautical miles. Coverage is divided into four primary units: 
<br/>
1. East Coast -U.S./Canada Border at the St. Croix River to the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula (including the Keys) 
<br/>
2. Gulf of Mexico Coast -Southern tip of the Florida Peninsula (no Keys) to the U.S./Mexico Border at Brownsville, Texas. 
<br/>
3. West Coast -U.S./Mexico Border at Baja to U.S./Canada Border at the Straits of Juan DeFuca. 
<br/>
4. Great Lakes -All five lakes, in their entirety, including the connecting waterways (except the St. Lawrence River/Seaway). 
<br/>
<br/>
For practical reasons the sections were further divided into three or more components: 
<br/>
Atlantic Coastal Section: 
<br/>

ec80_02 - Little River Inlet South Carolina to Cape Henry, Virginia; 
ec80_03 - Chesapeake Bay; 
ec80_04 - Chincoteague Inlet Virginia to Block Island Sound Rhode Island; 
ec80_05 - Point Judith to St. Croix River; 
ec80_06 - St. Mary's River, Florida to Florida Bay (including the Florida Keys.); 
<br/>
Gulf Coastal Section: 
<br/>
gc80_01 - Padre Island TX to Bayou Choupique, LA; 
gc80_02 - Lake Calcasieu, LA to Atchafalaya Bay, LA; 
gc80_03 - Point Au Fer, LA to Barataria Pass, LA; 
gc80_04 - Grand Terre Island, LA to Gulfport, MS, incl. the Chandeleurs Islands; 
gc80_05 - Biloxi River, MS to Chassahowitza Reefs, FL; 
gc80_06 - Chassahowitza Reefs, FL to Flamingo, FL; 
<br/>
Pacific Coastal Section: 
<br/>
wc80_01 - Semiahoo Bay, WA to Yaquina Head, OR; 
wc80_02 - Alsea Bay, OR to Point Sur, CA; 
wc80_03 - Point Sur, CA to U.S./Mexico Border; 
<br/>
Great Lakes Section: 
<br/>
gl80_01 - Lake Superior; 
gl80_02 - Lake Michigan incl. Lake Winnebago, WI; 
gl80_03 - Lake Huron incl. North Channel, and Georgian Bay; 
gl80_04 - Lake Erie incl. Detroit, St. Clair, and Niagara Rivers, and Lake St. Clair; 
gl80_05 - Lake Ontario incl. St. Lawrence River to Ogdensburg, NY.
